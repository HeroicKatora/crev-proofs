comment: |
  The crate contains no comments on how the supposed constant time operations
  are actually achieved. There is no mention of a memory model, no discussion
  of references, black boxes, speculation, optimization, etc. And on top of
  these theoretical shortcomings the crate also contains no tests to verify any
  of their assumptions. This means: no `asm` output review, no smoke tests for
  operation's time dependencies and a general lack of even functional tests.
  
  The `classify` method is just a glorified constructor and even contains a
  generic which will in general have no guarantees and is totally misplaced
  here. And `declassify` doesn't really do anything since the whole type state
  can always be dereferenced into the underlying type if the compiler pleases
  (and, oh, it will).
  
  An unexplained fill-horn of converters is added. Since they do not perform
  any more robust sequencing or basic optimization barriers, one might as well
  use the `classify` constructor instead. They are even declared `#[inline]`!
  
  Some allocating to-bytes converters are offered. Despite plainly leaking all
  values into the global heap without any protection or zeroing after
  expiration, they have no documentation, unlike much less dangerous methods.
  
  Despite the fact that several operations are disallowed as a 'security
  feature', an inconsistent other set is allowed. Overflow checked operations
  will, almost by definition, at least contain conditional moves if compiled
  naively using the built-ins. But for some unexplained reason, the division
  operation of all is untrusted!
  
  Many other such ops -- with invalid and panicking inputs or similar -- exist:
  Rotations will probably do a branch on the input value, additions overflow
  check and complain etc. in debug code. Maybe the bitwise operations are not
  totally broken.
  
  WORST! Some operations are transliterated from WireGuard. But they contain
  TYPOS that plainly contradict newly introduced variable names. How do they
  even work? It is not explained.
  
  By the way, the code is copied from a GPL licensed project (WireGuard) but
  the crate itself advertises an MIT license. So this might also be a licensing
  risk for the future.
