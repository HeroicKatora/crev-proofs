  As a side effect of the linear time requirements it also ensures that
  allocations are bounded. However, there is no built-in way to interoperate
  with any custom limits, precalculate required memory, or reuse allocations
  made separately before.

  Not quite ready for untrusted input due to panics and not fuzzed. Minor
  soundness concerns for floating point operations, rooted in Rust language
  `as` operator not having fully specified behaviour (yet). All is well for the
  integer part of the library.

  A bit puzzling that the inline implementation does not use `UnsafeCell`
  directly but only through `Cell`. This adds a Sync impl which explicitely can
  not exist for Cell itself. But the Once is enough to protect against races
  even though there is no real benefit from using `Cell` over `UnsafeCell`.
