  Liberal use of `unsafe` and sparse validation of in puts indices and offsets.
  In principle, the dtb format lends itself well to this use as the file format
  itself already requires the alignment of many members and takes care to have
  naturally packed structsâ€“with aligned members but no padding.
  
  It is thus possibly safe to map many parts of an immutable input directly to
  structs marked as `repr(C)`, which also correctly appears.
  
  However, the `unsafe` blocks contain only few indications of consideration of
  their safety. Sometimes alignment checks appear obviously above but most
  iterators implicitely trust their callers on the alignment of internal
  buffers. It also seems that not all functions relying on `unsafe`
  preconditions are marked `unsafe`. This applies to internal functions only
  but may make the crate more brittle than necessary.
  
  Another antipattern is that of a byte output buffer: A `StructItem` offers
  reading its value as strings or a `u32` list. But instead of an iterator over
  the backing memory the implementation takes an mutable reference to a byte
  slice, manually aligns it to fit the output type, casts it, and writes the
  data types `&'_ str` and `u32`. I have not found concrete misbehaviour from
  this but it seems awkward.
